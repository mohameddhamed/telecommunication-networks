# Tic-Tac-Toe Socket Assignment

- Complete tic-tac-toe/server.py to implement a tic-tac-toe server that listens on port 10000.
- Push your code to the main branch.
- Check the "Actions" tab for test results. Fix any failures based on the error messages.
- You won’t see the test file—it’s hidden to ensure you understand the socket logic.
